  <p>I've revamped my website to get a more accurate picture of where I am professionally.</p>

<p>I also wanted to take a look at my old code. It was fun. I cleaned up some things. Updated my photo. Added this blog.</p>

<p>I want to use posts from this blog to connect to professional career sites. I’d like to draw more traffic to my site. I can also format my ideas the way I want this way, add pictures, etc. You can find this blog in the ‘About’ section. I hope to use it to share ideas and new projects I am working on outside of work. There are a few cool ones I am excited to share. Stay tuned for those. </p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my site.</p>
